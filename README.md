**Dr. ir. Michiel Stock**

Notes and exercises of the optimization course given in the Master of Bioinformatics Bioscience Engineering and Systems Biology (Ghent University).

The goal of this course is to give students a general overview of the rich field of mathematical optimization. This course will put a particular emphasis on **practical implementations** and **performance**. After this course, students should be able to formulate problems from computational biology as optimization problems and be able to read, understand and implement new optimization algorithms.

The project exercises are done in the Python 3.x programming language. It is recommended to use [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) to install Python, the required libraries and the Jupyter notebook environment.

## Using this repository

Course notes are available in Markdown format. Slides and pdf notes will be distributed via [Minerva](http://minerva.ugent.be/). Every week we will cover a new chapter. Exercises of the chapters are available in the Jupyter notebooks. Ideally, you work in a local clone of this repository. Students without a laptop (or curious browsers) can make the exercises in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) by clicking on the badge below.

**It seems that Binder does not allow to save your work. This is especially important for the project assignments, which have to be handed in via the student publications in Minerva. Download your notebook after use!**

## Contents

This course consists of three main parts:
1. Continuous convex optimization problems
2. Discrete optimization problems solvable in polynomial time
3. 'Hard problems', NP hard problems and complex problems with no guarantees on optimality and performance

More detailed, tentative overview:

      - *application*: signal recovery
2. **Unconstrained convex problems**
      - convexity and convex problems
      - gradient descent revisited
      - steepest descent methods, coordinate descent
      - Newton's method:
        - as a special case of steepest descent

    - motivation: the KERMIT dessert party
    - quick recap of probability distributions
    - Monge and Kantorovich formulation
    - Wasserstein distances and Geodesic displacements

        - learning epigenetic landscapes
6. **Minimum spanning trees**:
    - graphs and basic data structures (i.e. `list`, `dict`, `set`)
    - introduction to time complexities
    - Prim's algorithm
