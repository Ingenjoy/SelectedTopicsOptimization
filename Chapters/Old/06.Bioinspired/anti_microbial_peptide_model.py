A relatively simple model to predict the antimicrobial activity of a peptide

Peptides are described by a set of features using (auto)correlation of the
physicochemical properties of the amino acids. These features are calculated
for a dataset of peptides showing antimicrobial activity. We subsequently use
a very simple kernel embedding model to represent the distribution of the
peptides.
