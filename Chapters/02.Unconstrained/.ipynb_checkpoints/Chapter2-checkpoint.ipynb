    "1. Derive and implement the loss function for logistic loss, the gradient and the Hessian of this loss function. These functions have as input the parameter vector $\\mathbf{w}$, label vector $\\mathbf{y}$, feature matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\lambda$. The logistic map and cross-entropy is already provided for you.\n",
    "2. Consider $\\lambda=0.1$, find the optimal parameter vector for this data using gradient descent, coordinate descent and Newton's method. Use standardized features. For each algorithm, give the number of steps the algorithm performed and the running time (use the [magic function](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html) `%timeit`). Compare the loss for each of parameters obtained by the different algorithms.\n",
    "3. How does regularization influence the optimization? Make a separate plot for gradient descent, coordinate descent and Newton's method with the the value of the loss as a function of the iteration of the given algorithm. Make separate the different methods and plot the convergence for $\\lambda = [10^{-3}, 10^{-1}, 1, 10, 100]$. Does increased regularization make the optimization go faster or slower? Why does this make sense?"
