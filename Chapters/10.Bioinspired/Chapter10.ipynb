    "## Introduction and general idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The open (or obsessive) mind can find optimization everywhere in the world around him. Ants find the optimal paths from food to their nest, rivers stream to maximize their water flow, plants maximize the amount of sunlight captured with their leafs and many of the laws of physics can be formulated as a minimization of energy. Bio-inspired optimization, or bio-inspired computing in general, borrows ideas from nature to solve complex problems. A central theme among these paradigms is that they use simple, local manipulations from which the general computation is an emergent property. Many also make use of a **population** of candidate solutions which is improved iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bio-inspired optimization algorithms (BIOAs) are often applied for more complex problems discussed so far. Many real-word problems are often over-or underconstrained, lack detailed information about the target function (e.g. no gradient can be computed) or deal with complex 'structured' data. Examples of such problems which (bioscience)engineers routinely deal with include designing an antenna, callibrating a forest fire model or create a new functional peptide (topic of this project).\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to most of the algorithms discussed so far, BIOAs often lack theoretical guarantees, both on their running time and on the quality of the solution. It is not uncommon to let such algorithms run for days or weeks. Since these algorithms do not exploit the structure or the gradient of the target function, only function evalutions are used. This is especially costly when evaluating the target function is expensive, for example when determining the parameters of a large set of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, most bio-inspired optimization algorithms have some hyperparameters which must be tuned to the problem, otherwise the optimization might run badly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these drawbacks, BIOAs also have many merits. Because they are very flexible, they can be applied to almost any optimization problem. For some problem classes (such as NP-complete problems), there are no efficient exact solvers, making for example the traveling salesman problem unsolvable for moderately large instances using standard techniques. BIOAs on the other hand can often generate reasonable solutions quite quickly. Furthermore, BIOAs work **progressive**, meaning that intermediate solutions can be obtained at any time. Hence, even if the optimization process is prematurely aborted, we still have some result to show for our effort."

    "3. Finally, complete the function `genetic_algorithm`. You also have to complete the functions `tournament_selection` and `recombinate` which will be used in the main algorithm. Try to find the an optimal peptide of length twenty as well, using some trial and error to find the hyperparameters. \n",
