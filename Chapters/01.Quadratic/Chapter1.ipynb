    "\n",
    "Even on simple quadratic problems as discussed here, gradient descent often takes a surprisingly large number of steps to converge. This is because the gradient does not necessarily points in the general direction of the minimum. For convex problems, we are only guaranteed that the gradient points in the half-space of the minimum - a rather weak guarantee! Many improvements on gradient descent have been devised. We will briefly discuss a small modification which can lead to a very large improvement in performance."

Rather than observing this vector directly, we have $m$ noisy measurements at random indices (indices drawn randomly with replacement from $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$): $\\mathcal{O} = \\{(i_j, y_j)\\mid j=1,\\ldots,m\\}$. These measurements are stored in an $m$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{y}$. Can we recover $\\mathbf{x}$ from $\\mathbf{y}$?\n",
    "\n",
    "If $m<n$, then we do not have a single measurement for every element of $\\mathbf{x}$. Even if $m>n$, it is likely that some elements of $\\mathbf{x}$ are not observed due to chance (for large $n$, if $n=m$ then about 37% of the elements will not be sampled). Clearly, recovering $\\mathbf{x}$ from $\\mathbf{y}$ is an impossible assumption if we do not make some assumptions, this seems an impossible problem in general.\n",

For our purposes, we have chosen this matrix as such that elements should have values closes to each other. Hence, the minimization problem has two terms:\n",
